# workorderManagementSystem

<h3>What?</h3>

This program was developed to be used in a building maintenance setting. The user can create and track repair workorders. Future updates can include 
cost forecasting, flagging repeat units (potential trouble tennants), or track/remind of yearly maintenance. 


<h3>Why?</h3>

This project was written as a final assignment for semester 4 of computer programming and analysis for George Brown College (GBC). It is for
the open source course (look at this public repo WOW!) and is written entirely using Python.
